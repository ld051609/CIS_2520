## Assignment Overview
What is the assignment about?  
Explain the purpose of the program and what it accomplishes.
Q1: Write a C program that takes as input a fully parenthesized, arithmetic expression of binary operators +, −, *, /, and converts the expression into a binary expression tree. Your program should take input from the command line. The entire expression should be in a character string without any space in it.
An input string only includes floating numbers in the format of Y.YY, that is, one digit to the left of the decimal point and two digits to the right of the decimal point, and variables of the form of x_1, x_2, x_3, ....
Your program shall allow for the leaves in the expression tree not only to store floating values but also to store variables of the form x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., For example, expression (((x_1+5.12)*(x_2-7.68))/x_3) will be converted into a binary expression tree

Q2: Write a C program that reads 200 2-digit integers from a text file “f.dat” and stores the integers in an array of 20 rows and 10 columns.
The program treats each row of the array as an object, with the sum of the first three integers being the key, and the other seven integers being the information content.
The program then creates a MAX-HEAP with a node containing an object. You are required to use an array representation of the heap, and apply the parental node downheap algorithm in the array representation. The program finally displays the heap as a 20 ×10 array, a row for an object.


Did you use any resources (for example book, notes etc) in this assignment?
Yes, I did used the resource to learn about preorder, inorder, and postorder and used the lecture slides to help me with question 2 about heap.
